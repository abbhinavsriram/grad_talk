The process of applying to colleges is a stressful time for both students and their families. It involves research to find the perfect college, major, and scholarships in addition to rigorous essay writing. Although there are various resources put in place to aid students with college preparation (online forums, college counselors), there is a massive disparity in their quality and availability to families. The National Center for Education Statistics estimates that there will be around 3.7 million high school students who graduate in the 2022-2023 academic year. Furthermore, the market size of US education consultants is valued at $2.9 billion as of 2022 (according to research conducted by IBISWorld). Therefore, there is a clear demand for a mainstream service that will allow families to connect with mentors who can give them insights on their desired major or college.
	A social networking application will help solve the issue in question because it facilitates consistent communication between a mentor and a family. Through this app, parents can input their child’s academic information (test scores, extracurriculars) and receive advice from a mentor from a major or college of their choice. 
Initially, I plan to partner with universities and other college-advising nonprofits to gain mentors in addition to local college students. However, as the app grows, it will rely on the steady stream and retention of mentors every year who can provide unique insights on colleges; therefore, one of the primary focuses of the app is to incentivize mentors to join the app. To achieve this, I plan to monetize the app through the following methods: donations, subscription plans, and sponsorships/advertisements from colleges. This revenue will then be distributed as rewards to high-performing mentors (such as mentors who win a regional “mentor of the month” prize) through the form of gift cards or similar incentives. I hope that this app will expand beyond the United States to international countries like the U.K., Canada, and India, where educational consultants are popular.
